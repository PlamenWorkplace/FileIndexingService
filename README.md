# Usage Guide

### Usage:
1. Initially, load a **file** or a **directory** containing multiple files.
2. The loaded files will be displayed in the **scroll panel** located on the lower half of the screen.
3. Enter a word in the **text box** to search for files that contain that specific word.

    - **Example**: In a test case with 7 files, only one file contained the word "Ipsum", so only this file was displayed.

### Limitations:
- The search is limited to **whole words** only. It would be more flexible to search for parts of words or combinations of several words (similar to search suggestions in a browser).
- You can only load **one directory at a time**. If you load a new directory, the previously loaded files will be erased.
